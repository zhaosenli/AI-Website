            <h2>The History of AI</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence has a rich history that dates back to the mid-20th century. Here are some key milestones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1956:</strong> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at the Dartmouth Conference.</li>
                <li><strong>1970s:</strong> Expert systems were developed, which could perform specific tasks like diagnosing diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>1980s:</strong> AI research faced funding cuts but saw a resurgence with the development of neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>1990s:</strong> Machine learning algorithms improved, leading to better speech recognition and image processing.</li>
                <li><strong>2000s:</strong> AI became more integrated into everyday products, such as smartphones and personal assistants.</li>
                <li><strong>2010s:</strong> Advances in deep learning and big data led to significant improvements in AI capabilities.</li>
